Well, it's been a long while since SuperMario was officially released upon the Mugen scene. I have been gone for a few years, so I missed the whole WinMugen-hack-thing or whatever happened. I hope the folks of Elecbyte are doing well, and I thank you so very much for everything you've done for the communty. God bless you guys.

I suppose you could consider this the 102% version of SuperMario for WinMugen. It's basically just the old DOS version with some tweaking. Future updates may possibly be released with minor additions or fixes.


CHANGES TO THIS VERSION:

- Some artwork changes (Portraits, EX AirGlide, etc.)
- Added sounds, and some voice edits by JudgeSpear.
- Coding optimized by Winane, as well as palettes and several other problems with WinMugen.
- Spin Throw glitch, and other WinMugen glitches fixed by Valodim.
- Attack power weakened. He was way too strong before with how combo-easy he is.
- Palettes have been given subtle differences to stand apart from each other.
- All attacks that required 2 punches or 2 kicks can be done with any combination of X,Y,Z or A,B,C.
- Coins added to Coin Punch by Thomas Hsieh, optimized by Winane.

INSTALLATION:

•When you download Mario, unzip him and make sure the folder name is "SuperMario".
•Place "SuperMario" folder into the "chars" folder within the folder for Mugen.
•Go to "data" folder...the open "select" def file using NOTEPAD.
•Scroll down to where it says the following:



;Insert your characters below.

kfm, stages/kfm.def

;-----------------------



•Type in "SuperMario" above or below "kfm". Like so:


;Insert your characters below.

SuperMario
kfm, stages/kfm.def

;-----------------------


Save the altered "select" file....and SuperMario will then show up in the Character Selection screen next time you run Mugen.

For stages, empty the stage's contents into the "stages" folder, then in the "select" file, type in the stage's name under the section for extra stages. Like so:


stages/PeachCastle.def



If you want Mario's default stage to be Peach's Castle....put his name like this in the characters section of the "select" file:


;Insert your characters below.

SuperMario, stages/PeachCastle.def
kfm, stages/kfm.def

;-----------------------

GAMEPLAY:


SuperMario is a six-button character, and can "chain" most attacks together.


X - Light Punch (jab)

Y - Medium Punch (strong)

Z - Hard Punch (fierce)

A - Light Kick (short)

B - Medium (forward)

C - Hard Kick (roundhouse)


He can double jump, and tapping forward twice makes him run.

Tapping back twice makes him roll backward mostly invincible.

Tapping 2 kicks simultaneously makes him roll forward invincible

Down+Z is his "launcher", knocking the opponent into the air.

Hold up directly after to "super jump" up with them to combo. Tapping down then up quickly also super jumps

Down+C is his spinning sweep kick...hits opponents in front and behind him. 

Press Start to make him taunt....which can give him more super meter.
